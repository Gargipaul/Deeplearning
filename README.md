# üß† **Image Classification - Deep Learning**

This project is focused on learning and implementing deep learning techniques and their various applications.
Each Jupyter Notebook is designed as a tutorial that applies deep learning models using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python libraries on datasets obtained from public sources.

# üìñ **Project Description**

This repository is dedicated to the learning, exploration, and implementation of deep learning techniques, with a focus on image classification tasks.
Each Jupyter Notebook serves as a hands-on tutorial, demonstrating how to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python libraries.

The datasets used are sourced from public repositories to provide real-world challenges for model development and evaluation.

# üéØ **Project Goals**

- Understand the fundamentals of deep learning for computer vision.

- Apply popular deep learning frameworks to image classification problems.

- Practice building end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

This repository will be continuously updated as new models, techniques, and tutorials are developed.
