ðŸ§  Image Classification - Deep Learning

This project is focused on learning and implementing deep learning techniques and their various applications. Each Jupyter Notebook is designed as a tutorial that applies deep learning models using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python libraries on datasets obtained from public sources.

ðŸ“š Project Structure
This repo is for learning and implementation of deep learning and its various applications. Each jupyter notebook is a tutorial on applying deep learning using tensorflow, keras and python libraries on dataset obtained from public sources.

For this project, create a virtual environment in conda. Install pip, matplotlib, tensorflow. Set this conda environment on jupyter notebook, by installing ipykernel. 

The Read Me will be updated as when progress is made.
